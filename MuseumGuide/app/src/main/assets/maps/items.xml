		<description>The Starry Night is an oil on canvas by the Dutch post-impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh.
Painted in June, 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-Remy-de-Provence, just before sunrise, with the addition of an idealized village.
It is regarded as among Van Gogh's finest works, and one of the most recognized monuments in the history of Western culture.</description>

		<description>The Kiss (Lovers) was painted by the Austrian Symbolist painter Gustav Klimt between 1908 and 1909, the highpoint of his "Golden Period", when he painted a number of works in a similar gilded style.
The work is composed of oil paint with applied layers of gold leaf, an aspect that gives it its strikingly modern, yet evocative appearance.
It is a symbol of Vienna Jugendstil—Viennese Art Nouveau—and is considered Klimt's most popular work.</description>
